ðŸ“Œ Approach & Assumptions for Marriage Matchmaking App

âœ… Approach (How We Built This)

Used FastAPI for a fast, scalable backend.
Implemented CRUD operations to create, read, update, and delete user profiles.
Designed a matchmaking system that finds matches based on:
Opposite gender
Same city
Used SQLite + SQLAlchemy for easy database management.
Added email validation using Pydanticâ€™s EmailStr.
Ensured proper error handling (e.g., user not found, email already exists).


âœ… Assumptions (What We Considered)

Matchmaking is based only on gender and city (not interests or age).
Each user has a unique email to prevent duplicate accounts.
Users can update their details partially (optional fields in PUT /users/{id}).
A user can be deleted permanently (no soft delete).
The app is a backend only (no frontend, only API).
